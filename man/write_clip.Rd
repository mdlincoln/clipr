\usage{
write_clip(content, object_type = c("auto", "character", "table"),
  breaks = NULL, eos = NULL, return_new = TRUE,
  allow_non_interactive = Sys.getenv("ALLOW_CLIPBOARD", interactive()),
  ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{content}{An object to be written to the system clipboard.}

\item{object_type}{write_clip() tries to be smart about writing objects in a
useful manner. If passed a data.frame or matrix, it will format it using
\code{\link{write.table}} for pasting into an external spreadsheet program.
It will otherwise coerce the object to a character vector. \code{auto} will
check the object type, otherwise \code{table} or \code{character} can be
explicitly specified.}

\item{breaks}{The separator to be used between each element of the character
vector being written. \code{NULL} defaults to writing system-specific line
breaks between each element of a character vector, or each row of a table.}

\item{eos}{The terminator to be written after each string, followed by an
ASCII \code{nul}. Defaults to no terminator character, indicated by
\code{NULL}.}

\item{return_new}{If true, returns the rendered string; if false, returns the
original object}

\item{allow_non_interactive}{By default, clipr will throw an error if run in
a non-interactive session. Set the environment varible
\code{ALLOW_CLIPBOARD=TRUE} in order to override this behavior, for
instance while testing a package that uses clipr. You may not run clipr on
CRAN, as the nature of xsel
\href{https://github.com/mdlincoln/clipr/issues/38}{has caused issues in
the past}.}

\item{...}{Custom options to be passed to \code{\link{write.table}} (if the
object is a table-like) Defaults to sane line-break and tab standards based
on the operating system.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the original object
}
\description{
Write a character vector to the system clipboard
}
\note{
On X11 systems, \code{write_clip} will cause either xclip (preferred)
  or xsel to be called. Be aware that, by design, these processes will fork
  into the background until the next paste event, when they will then exit
  silently.
